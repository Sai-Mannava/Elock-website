      Roam is a bike that I put at least a thousand miles on and carried countless memories of my biking adventures. It was with Roam that I started my biking youtube channel Bound2Bike and I was very attached to the bike. On the second day I was here at UC Davis my bike was stolen even the U-lock and wired lock were both gone as well. I was heartbroken and swore that until I find a valid lock I wouldnâ€™t buy another bike thus I have been walking around campus so far. As I browsed the internet for all kinds of locks, I realized that companies are just making more bulkier and heavier locks which thieves can cut through given time. I recognized the problem which is that bike lock security is outdated and needs to be innovated. Modern technologies like cloud interfaces integrated with physical electronics are prominent. For example, airtags, ADT security system, and Nest doorbell. As an Applied physics-computational physics concentration major I am passionate about prototyping E-lock and testing it here in Davis. With that in mind, I wanted to apply to internship programs where I can sharpen my software engineering skills and gain exposure to the tech industry.
