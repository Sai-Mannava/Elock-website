      Whether it's deciding to invest in my idea, me, both, or neither. All I can promise is that I will continue to develop my skillset and look into cloud technologies for E-lock's software. Realistically, software internships have students from CalTech to MIT as applicants. In terms of IQ, skillset, or even just overall intelligence I can't compete with these candidates. What differentiates me from all the other candidates is that I don't get many opportunities. As an applied physics major, I need to fight to take programming courses or compete in hackathons. I pitched my idea to the Google developer Student Club in Davis and I got accepted into their Tech Lead program. Internships are a step up and will give me the opportunity to establish my footing in the software industry. If I am given the opportunity to be an engineering intern I can promise that I will do my best to attend every workday and put my all into the projects.
